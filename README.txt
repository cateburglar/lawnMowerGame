# Lawn Mowing Group Project

For our 2022 Fall CSI 1430 group project, we did a variation of the snake game. This is a lawn mowing game that allows players to mow a lawn as long as possible without hititng any obstacles (rocks). The score in the game is based off how long the player can stay alive. All requirements fulfilled which include: SDL Plotter, score, high score, pause, save, color and sound.


## Instructions
-Download the zip file and open and run the main.cpp file in preferred IDE. All needed files for the game are in the folder.
-Choose a mode for difficulty by pressing e, m, or h and then press space to start game. The difficulty determines the frequency of the obstacles to appear. C is used to continue from the last saved game. The saved game saves the score of the last game, not the location of the lawn mowers and the obstacles. 
-Once the game starts, the goal is to mow as much lawn without hitting any rocks. If the player hits a rock or mows off the screen, the game will end. 
-The highest score, which is based off of the longest gameplay, will be determined after each game. The user can press the P key at any time to pause tha game and then must press space to resume if they wish to continue. The S key will save your current score and then end the game if pressed. Music will play during the game and end if the player dies. 
-The highscore will be saved in it's own file as well as the saved score if the game is saved.
